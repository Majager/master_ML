# Meal onset detection using sound
This repository contains all files developed during the Master's thesis to implement Linear Discriminant Analysis and Hidden Markov Model to investigate whether meal onset detection benefits from temporal modeling. The aim of this is to provide improvements for a fully automatic artificial pancreas.
The code implements feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, post-processing, class separation, and probability analysis for optimization. For testing, an 80:20 train-test split and Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation are implemented. Explainable AI techniques were applied to interpret the model behavior and identify features relevant to meal phases.
