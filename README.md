# Meal onset detection using sound
This repository contains all files developed during the Master's thesis to implement Linear Discriminant Analysis and Hidden Markov Model to investigate whether meal onset detection benefits from temporal modeling. 

The code implements feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, post-processing, class separation and probability analysis for optimization
For testing there is implemented a 80:20 train-test split and Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation
Explainable AI techniques were applied to interpret the model behavior and identify features relevant to meal phases
